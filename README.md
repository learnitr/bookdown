# Course template with bookdown and learnitdown

This is a template for course material using the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) format with [{learnitdown}](https://github.com/learnitr/learnitdown) additions. Read the [documentation](https://learnitr.github.io/learnitrdoc/) (in French only for now, unfortunately) for more information and also look at the `07-learnitdown.Rmd` file.
